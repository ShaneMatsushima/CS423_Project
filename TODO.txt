===SEQUENCING===
Blastp selected sequences
align sequence
analyze areas of similarity
analyze distant but related sequences
add loading bar to show progress of blastp

===MODELING===
take in sequence or fasta (preferably) for prediction
predict model
display model 
highlight aa conserved and families
add loading bar to show progress of prediction and rendering
